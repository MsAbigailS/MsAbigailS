👋 Hey there!

I'm a recent Computer Science grad from The University of Texas at Dallas — a proud first-generation college student and Terry Scholar — currently on the hunt for my next adventure in software development.

I thrive on building creative, challenge-driven projects using **Python, JavaScript, and whatever other tools the job calls for**. I believe a strong developer isn't married to one language — it’s about **solving real problems** with the right tech, and writing clean, thoughtful code while doing it.

🧠 Interests & Passions

    🧪 Creative coding that blends tech with usability
    
    🌿 Botany nerd — I grow plants and projects in equal measure

    🎮 Video game enthusiast (and occasional game dev)

    ⚙️ Hackathon addict: 8 wins and counting

    🤖 Excited about AI and cutting-edge tech

    ☕ Deeply committed to caffeine — some might call it a lifestyle choice

💼 Currently...

Looking to join a collaborative dev team where I can contribute, learn, and maybe even win a few more hackathons. If you're building something ambitious (and cool), I want in.

🤫 But why so few commits?

Let’s just say... most of my best work is in private repos, local folders, or fueled by caffeine at 3 AM and forgotten to be pushed. I’m working on that. 😅
